The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories.

# VIEW remote repo name & location to 'push' to & 'fetch' from
git remote -v
# ADD remote repo
git remote add <name> <url>
# REMOVE remote repo
git remote remove <name>
# RENAME remote repo
git remote rename <name> <new-name>

# EXAMPLE by steps to remove, add, and rename an existing github repo

# 1. VIEW if project already has remote repo
git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/johndoe/my-repo.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/johndoe/my-repo.git (push)

# 2. REMOVE the remote repo and (optional) confirm
git remote remove origin
git remote
# line should be blank

# 3. ADD new remote repo and confirm (should see 'origin')
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/new-repo.git
git remote
origin

# 4. RENAME the remote repo to 'upstream'
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote
upstream

# NOTE: 'origin' is just a standard convention name, remote repos are
# named to use a shorthand instead of the long url
