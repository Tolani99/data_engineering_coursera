Task 3:

It is very important for little lemon to keep track of the status of each guestâ€™s order and display it on the screen to keep their guests informed.

This is how they categorize the orders:

If not assigned to any employee, the status is In Queue

If assigned to the employees with IDs 4 and 5, the status is Preparing Order

If assigned to the employees with IDs 1, 2, and 3, the status is Order Served


Create a stored procedure named OrderStatus for the above task and call to check if everything is working.
