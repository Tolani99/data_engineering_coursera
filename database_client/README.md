Task 1:

Help Little Lemon establish a connection to their MySQL database using Python, via MySQL Connector/Python API so that they can access data according to their business needs. 

To achieve this task, complete the following steps:

Step 1: Import the appropriate MySQL connector library using the alias connector.

Step 2: Next, create a variable called connection and use it to store an instance of the connection made with the database using the connector module. This module uses a method called connect() and you should provide the relevant connection details.

Task 2:

Little Lemon need to write clean safe code and must ensure that there are no connection issues when connecting with MySQL database. They have heard of Pythonâ€™s try/except blocks and are interested in incorporating them into their own code.  

Step 1: As above, import an instance of MySQL connector using the alias connector.

Step 2: Open a try block and place the appropriate connection code within it

Step 3: Now fill in the code for when an error occurs. What is an appropriate message to display on the screen?

Task 3:

Little Lemon need to identify the reason for any issues that might occur when connecting to the database. Help them to retrieve the error code along with the error message in the following situations: 

When the database does not exist.

When a wrong username or password is entered.
