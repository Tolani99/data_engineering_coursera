To connect python with a mysql database, you can use the mysql connector/python module, which provides an interface for interfacing with mysql database from python. Here's a guide.
* Install the mysql connector/python module:
-Open terminal
-Install module using the piop: pip install mysql-conector-python

syntax: 
import mysql.connector
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
	host = "your_host"
	user = "your_username"
	password = "your_password"
	database = "your_database"
)
#Create a cursor object to execute sql queries
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
result = cursor.fetchall()
for row in result:
	print(row)
connection.commit()
cursor.close()
connection.close()

"""
Remember to replace the placeholders ("Your host, "your usernan", "Your password", "Your database", "Your table")

By following these steps, you can establish a connection between Python and a Mysql database, execute SQL and retrieve and process the results in your Python script
