In a database, a view is a virtual table that does not store data physically. Instead, it is a query-defined table that displays data from one or more tables in the database, or even from other views.

Views are created using SELECT statements with optional WHERE, GROUP BY, and JOIN clauses to filter and organize data. Views can be used to simplify complex queries by hiding the underlying complexity of the database schema and presenting the data in a more meaningful way to users.

Once a view is created, it can be treated like a regular table, and queries can be performed against it just like any other table in the database. Views can be used to restrict user access to sensitive data, simplify data access for end-users, or provide summary information from multiple tables.

In summary, a view in a database is a virtual table that is created using a SELECT statement and is used to present data from one or more tables in a simplified manner.
