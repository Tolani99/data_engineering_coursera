The given SQL query will return a result set that includes the client information, order information, and product information for all orders made in the years 2021 and 2022, sorted by the order date.

SELECT Clients.ClientID, Clients.ContactNumber, Addresses.Street, Addresses.County,  Orders.OrderID, Orders.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Orders.Cost, Orders.Date
This line specifies the columns that will be returned in the result set.

FROM Clients
INNER JOIN Addresses ON Clients.AddressID = Addresses.AddressID
INNER JOIN Orders ON Clients.ClientID = Orders.ClientID
INNER JOIN Products ON Orders.ProductID = Products.ProductID
This section of the query uses inner joins to combine data from multiple tables. It joins the Clients table with the Addresses table on the AddressID column, the Clients table with the Orders table on the ClientID column, and the Orders table with the Products table on the ProductID column.

WHERE YEAR (Orders.Date) = 2021 OR YEAR (Orders.Date) = 2022
This line specifies a filter condition to only return orders that were made in the years 2021 or 2022.

ORDER BY Orders.Date;
This line specifies that the result set should be sorted in ascending order by the date of the order.

The final result set will include information about clients, addresses, orders, and products for all orders made in 2021 and 2022, sorted by the order date.
